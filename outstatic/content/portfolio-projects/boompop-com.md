### Project Summary

We worked with [BoomPop.com](https://boompop.com/) to take over a large Next.js codebase from two groups of contractors. We developed the original BoomPop MVP from 2021 through 2022, when BoomPop closed a Series A funding round.

Post-Series A, the business continued to extend its growth curve, expanding from virtual events into event management for company offsites. We continued to work with BoomPop during this expansion, creating a new codebase for the new line of business.

Our time with BoomPop was marked by quick feature turnarounds and tight collaboration with the Product team. We moved extremely quickly to validate and exploit business opportunities in a fast-changing environment post-COVID.

### Technology

We built BoomPop.com with Next.js, WebFlow, and Amazon AWS using the [SST stack](https://sst.dev/).

We collaborated with Product over Figma, translating designs into pixel-perfect web application features.

Our feature development included creation and ownership of Instant Book checkout for virtual events as well as the [BoomPop Budget Optimizer](https://boompop.com/platform/budget-optimizer) that pulls in data from hotels and airlines to generate custom estimates across a matrix of hotels and travel dates.
