### Project Summary

[Calligraphy.org](http://Calligraphy.org) launched in 2012 as a joint project between [Chris](https://www.chrisesplin.com/) and [Melissa ](https://www.instagram.com/melissapher) Esplin.

Melissa is a calligrapher and had begun teaching local classes. Chris was just learning how to develop basic CRUD apps using the Symfony PHP framework.

They developed Calligraphy.org as an online learning application, attracting thousands of customers and growing the international community of calligraphers.

Chris worked full-time on Calligraphy.org from 2013 to late 2017.

### Technology

Chris rewrote the application three times, eventually landing on a Next.js front end with Firebase on the back end and checkout on Shopify.

The application is distributed across Shopify, GitHub, Vimeo, and Firebase Cloud Functions.

Shopify handles all shopping and checkout. GitHub and Vimeo host the content. Firebase Cloud Functions is the glue that connects everything together and provides APIs for the web client.
